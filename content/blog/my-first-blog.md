How can machine learning be harnessed to advance and improve imaging in patients with cancer?



This past May, the International Cancer Imaging Society (ICIS) organized a two-day meeting on “The Wizardry of Artificial Intelligence: AI and Machine Learning in Cancer Imaging.” The meeting’s goal was to bring together specialists in oncology, radiology, and AI from academe and industry to discuss issues related to machine learning and cancer imaging.



Our Radiology: Artificial Intelligence editorial board was well represented. Deputy Editor Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer delivered a superb talk on image annotation and data curation. Associate Editor Andrea Rockall detailed the reality and challenges of using imaging datasets for machine learning. Other speakers gave updates on machine learning related to workflow, biobanks, workforce training, ethics, and integration of AI into the clinical enterprise. My own lecture reviewed some important recent scientific publications.



The program drew more than 230 participants from 39 countries. The meeting was sponsored by the the Champalimaud Foundation of Lisbon, Portugal, and was hosted in the Foundation’s extraordinary conference center along the Tagus River.



The Champalimaud Foundation is an uncommon organization: it’s a private foundation that supports a conference venue with an adjacent clinical and research center. One can enjoy a stunning view of the Tagus River through a large “porthole” along one side of the auditorium. From the clinics, which specialize in cancer and neurosciences, one can view the laboratory spaces. The complex, engagingly named the “Centre for the Unknown,” was built on a site from which Vasco da Gama and other Portuguese explorers set sail on their own journeys into the unknown.



My presentation summarized current applications of AI in cancer imaging:



Risk assessment. AI can help direct imaging resources to those patients at greatest risk, such as women at highest risk for breast cancer.

Cancer screening. AI can help augment our efforts to detect cancer through active screening for diseases such as lung cancer and breast cancer. In addition, “opportunistic” screening can detect cancer in exams obtained for other purposes, and may improve our ability to detect cancers where directed screening tests would be impractical or cost-ineffective.

Cancer detection. Systems for automated detection, when integrated into routine radiology workflow, present opportunities to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of cancer diagnosis.

Diagnosis and classification. Machine learning system provides ways to improve classification of imaging findings related to cancer, such as breast density assessment.

Treatment response prediction. From among hundreds or thousands of potentially useful imaging features, machine learning techniques can identify those with the greatest prognostic value.

Radiology-Pathology Correlation. Matching radiology and pathology reports and images is useful for education, quality improvement, and patient care.
